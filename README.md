## What This Fork Adds

This fork builds on garagesteve's excellent foundation with features specifically designed for small account profitability, capital preservation, and tax compliance. All changes are backward compatible — set `account_mode: "force_existing"` to revert to 100% original behavior.

### Small Account Optimization (accounts under $2,500)
- **Auto-detection** of account size with appropriate settings applied automatically
- **10% position sizing** instead of 0.005% (turns $0.50 trades into $25 trades)
- **Linear DCA** (equal-size buys) instead of exponential (2x multiplier)
- **3 wider DCA levels** (-7.5%, -15%, -25%) instead of 7 aggressive levels
- **Max 3 concurrent positions** to prevent correlation overload
- **20% cash reserve** enforced to maintain dry powder

### Risk Management
- **Hard stop loss at -35%** with one-time neural L7 override before forced exit
- **Tiered profit taking** — sell 33% at +7%, 50% of remainder at +15%, trail the rest
- **Neural DCA confirmation** required before executing DCA entries on small accounts

### Enhanced GUI
- **Win rate %**, average win/loss, best/worst coin, and hard stop count in the Account box
- **Manual Buy panel** — place market buys from the Hub with auto coin-add and optional auto-train
- **Manual Sell panel** — select a held coin and sell 100% from the Hub
- **Tax Export panel** — one-click IRS Form 8949 CSV export for any tax year

### Data Accuracy
- **Paginated order fetching** — follows Robinhood's pagination up to 25 pages per coin to prevent cost basis corruption
- **Decimal precision P&L** — uses Python's `Decimal` type for cent-accurate profit/loss tracking
- **Form 8949 CSV export** — generates a tax-ready CSV with all required IRS columns, compatible with TurboTax, H&R Block, FreeTaxUSA, and other tax software

## Tax Export (Form 8949)

At the end of the tax year, use the Tax Export panel in the Hub GUI:

1. Enter the tax year (e.g., 2026)
2. Click **Export 8949 CSV**
3. The CSV is saved to `hub_data/form_8949_trades_YYYY.csv`
4. The containing folder opens automatically
5. Import the CSV into your tax software

The CSV includes all IRS Form 8949 columns: description of property, date acquired, date sold, proceeds, cost basis, gain or loss, and hold period (short-term vs long-term). A totals row is included at the bottom.
